# CS
 
This repository serves as a collection of all my Computer Science work done at Grand Valley State University. Each class is seperated into folders with their respective class numbers. Everything in this repository is completely original work by me, unless otherwise stated in the code.

### Course overviews
- CIS 162 - Computer Science I
  - This is the first introductory class into CS. It consists of rigorious use of Java, as well as 5 projects. The complexity of the projects increase constantly throughout the semester.
- CIS 163 - Computer Science II
  - This class is very similiar to Computer Science I, with more exploration of Java and more difficult projects.
- CIS 241 - System-Level Programming and Utilities
  - From this class, I learned C and C++ programming and the linux operating system. 
- CIS 343 - Structure of Programming Languages
  - I learned multiple langauges, including lisp, javascript, python, C++, and more from this class. I also wrote a research paper on the Ruby programming languages which is in this repository. 
- CIS 351 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language
  - An introduction class into assembly language and combinational logic. I learned how higher level languages all translate down to assembly code and how the system executes and interprets this assembly code.
- CIS 353 - Databases
  - Involves rigorious use of Oracle SQL and involved creating our own unique database in small development teams. Most of the class was dedicated towards creating our own database (more than half the semester). 
- CIS 452 - Operating Systems Concepts
  - A further exploration of assembly code and process management.
- MTH 225 - Discrete Structures I
  - A math class, it invovled understanding discrete math algorithms relating to computer science. This class consisted mostly of difficult homeworks and small programming assignments. 
- MTH 325 - Discrete Structures II
  - This class included a more in depth look at the algorithms we learned, as well as emphasis on trees and searching. Besides difficult homeworks, this class also invovled making a Python final project which can be seen in this repository.
