# CS
 
This repository serves as a collection of all my Computer Science work done at Grand Valley State University. Each class is seperated into folders with their respective class numbers. Everything in this repository is completely original work by me, unless otherwise stated in the code.

### Course overviews
Course | Desription
-------- | -----------
CIS 162 - Computer Science I | This is the first introductory class into CS. It consists of rigorous use of Java, as well as 5 projects. The complexity of the projects increases constantly throughout the semester. 
CIS 163 - Computer Science II | This class is very similar to Computer Science I, with more exploration of Java and more difficult projects.
CIS 241 - System-Level Programming and Utilities | From this class, I learned C and C++ programming and the Linux operating system. 
CIS 343 - Structure of Programming Languages | I learned multiple languages, including lisp, JavaScript, python, C++, and more from this class. I also wrote a research paper on the Ruby programming languages which is in this repository. 
CIS 351 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language | An introduction class into assembly language and combinational logic. I learned how higher-level languages all translate down to assembly code and how the system executes and interprets this assembly code.
CIS 353 - Databases | Involves rigorous use of Oracle SQL and involved creating our own unique database in small development teams. 
CIS 452 - Operating Systems Concepts | A further exploration of assembly code and process management.
MTH 225 - Discrete Structures I | Involved understanding discrete math algorithms relating to computer science. 
MTH 325 - Discrete Structures II | This class included a more in depth look at the algorithms we learned, as well as emphasis on trees and searching. Involved making a Python final project which can be seen in this repository.
